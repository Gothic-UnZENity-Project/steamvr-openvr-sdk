Manual updates:

SteamVR:
* Picked SteamVR.cs and SteamVR_Settings.cs from this PR (As the changes aren't inside 1.8.1 beta branch) --> https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/pull/491
* Remove OpenVRUnityXRPackage as folder and extract it into OpenVR. For our solution, we leverage both separately as Unity packages
